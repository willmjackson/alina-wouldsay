Our boys' rugby team lost a game away to another team
</CONTEXT>
<ideal_output>
Such a fantastic learning opportunity. It didn't feel great to be on the losing side- but very much enjoyed the experience- lots to take forward. 

Overall - a very nice vibe about this club. It felt (almost) like home! 

Quite similar to our coaches, both coaches we interacted with were outstanding in terms of energy and passion for the sports, but also a genuine care for players' development whatever the level. With almost 60 players overall, 18 of which at academy level, and two teams at upper level- it's arguably a good place to be and think abundantly. 
But, nevertheless, so nice to experience. 

Also, parents were nice to chat with, generous with their feedback and gracious in their celebrations. 

Very well drilled players made the match very enjoyable to watch - almost enough to keep the mind off the score üò¨Impressive, considering it was their development team. 
But on a good day our boys would have done much better, for sure. 

Shame it wasn't recorded. 

Now, party over. Hopefully everyone has a good rest this week. Take this valuable learning forward. And bring their A game on Sunday when it matters the most. 

C'mon Reigate! üëè

A losing game of rugby. Coach Nick describes it as a humbling experience.
</CONTEXT>
<ideal_output>
Thank you, Nick. 
Please let us know what we can do at home to help them bounce back. Reignite the spark that carried them through so many amazing and challenging seasons. 
They hopefully take learning forward, use this experience to grow from it - individually and as a team. 
But most importantly, whilst trying to process setbacks, they must remember to keep Enjoying playing together.
Sustaining the mutual respect and the banter that got them out of so many sticky situations. 
They're great boys, even greater as a bunch. 
C'mon Reigate- we're bigger and better than this. ‚≠êÔ∏è

Rugby coaches are disappointed in the team behavior at practice, feeling that the players are demotivated.
</CONTEXT>
<ideal_output>
It's complicated.

To achieve something, they need to become someone.

And years like this one are truly testing.

For their sense of being and belonging.

They're stretched. They're growing fast. They're tired. Trying to perform well at school , life and on the pitch. 

When performing is tough, motivation is challenging to secure. 

And with that - focus goes.


But the need to connect and belong to something greater is strong. A dream team!!

Unfortunately they only have the time on the pitch. In the rain, cold, mud. When they need to listen more and can express less.

The toughest of times can become the best of times. With patience and nurturing.

They are a great bunch. 
Last December was tough on them. That final might have broken their trust in themselves, the team, the process. It happens to the best of athletes. It happens in life. A lot. 

What an opportunity to help them grow! Piece it all together again until it really makes sense. One step at a time.

We've always celebrated their time on the pitch - win or lose. Because the real gain has always been their unity , their ability to pick each other up. Their trust in the process. Their becoming the gents we want to see. Years to come. 

We're all growing in the process. 

When they're at their worst is when they need us the most. 

Showing up is the hardest bit.
They're showing up. 

Perhaps not always at their best. But with the best intent. 

I'll always be grateful for the time coaches and parents put in to keep this team going. 
The last few years at the club have been incredible. Ups and downs and pure joy. 
We can still make this year memorable. Even if it's not going to be another trophy. 

C'mon Reigate. ‚≠êÔ∏è
